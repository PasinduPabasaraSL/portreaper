# PortReaper 💀

The silent harbinger that finds and kills processes occupying your ports.

```bash
portreaper find 3000     # Who dares occupy this port?
portreaper kill 3000     # Your time has come
portreaper kill 3000 -9  # No mercy
portreaper scan          # Reveal the living
portreaper monitor       # Watch. Wait. Reap.
